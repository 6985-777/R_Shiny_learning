# R Shiny Dashboard â€“ Case Study 2

## About the Course
This project was developed as part of the **Data Analyst course**, organized in collaboration with **Cevora, TMC, and VDAB**.  
The course provided hands-on practice to strengthen data analysis and visualization skills in real-world scenarios.

## Description
This project was created during the **second hands-on case study** of the Data Analyst course.  

It was my **first encounter with R Shiny**, and I tried to build a **web application with charts** that visualize the answers to the given questions.  

The code may not fully follow clean coding principles, since the main goal was to explore how Shiny works and practice.  
Through this work, I gained **introductory-level knowledge** of Shiny. ðŸš€  

During this learning process, I also benefited from **ChatGPT** as a supportive tool to clarify concepts and troubleshoot issues.
